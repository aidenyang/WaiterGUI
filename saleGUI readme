Sale GUI readme 
Alison Yang

Run this program from the SaleTester. It will prompt you for a file in the console. Give it any properly formatted menu and it will run fine. In the case that the file is not found,
program will terminate. Just run it again with the proper file. 

GUI is self explanatory. The program is set to output the orders to a file named orders.txt. A "day" is a session without terminating the program.
The receipts will be appended to orders.txt. 

Design patterns used:
Singleton
Used in the menu class, it makes sure that only one instance of menu is ever made. This is done by calling the getInstance() method in the MainView, 
and then only using the arraylist taken from that particular instance. 

Facade
Used in the MainView class, it simplifies more complicated subsystems like the innerworkings of the receipt and food panels by just using the initialize() method
to set up the GUI.
